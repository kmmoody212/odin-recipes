    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil or any cooking oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1 (7 oz) can tuna, drained</li>
        <li>1/4 medium onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>30 g carrot bell pepper, or other vegetables, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp shredded cheddar cheese, optional but highly recommended</li>
        <li>ketchup or soy sauce to serve, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients (with the exception of vegetable oil) in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and spoon about 3 tbsp of the mixture onto the pan. Round the edges with a spoon, and fry each side for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown, flattening them slightly to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and repeat again, adding more oil in between the batches as needed. Serve by dipping into ketchup or soy sauce over a bowl of rice, or eat them on their own. Enjoy!</li>
