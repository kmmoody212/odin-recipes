# 1. Project: Recipes
This is the first project in the Foundation Course with THE ODIN PROJECT. The purpose of this project is to practice using the HTML foundations I've learned so far.

## 2. Basic HTML Knowledge Demonstrated in this Project
- Creating appropriately sized headers for the recipe pages, the "ingredients" lists, and the "steps" lists.
- Using anchor tags on the index page to create links to other pages within the project.
- Adding images to each recipe page and alt text for each image.
- Writing paragraphs under each image to add context to the recipes.
- Creating ordered and unordered lists for the steps and ingredients of each recipe, respectively.
